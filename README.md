## Voting app
Tiny react voting app, just playing around. Vote on hardcoded values, see the winner.

* start with `foreman start -f Procfile.hot`
* visit http://localhost:8080/

Nice to have:
* Server side single user vote validation
* Restart vote button
* Customizable list to vote on
* Some styles (maybe show current tally on vote page)
